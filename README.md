<h2>Welcome to the Hangman Game repository! This is a classic word guessing game where you try to uncover a hidden word by guessing letters one at a time. This repository contains the source code and assets for the Hangman Game.</h2>

<ul>
<li>To play the game, visit the live version: https://yulo01.github.io/chamoxrchobana  </li>
<li>You have to guess the word by suggesting letters. Each correct letter guessed will be revealed in the word, and each incorrect guess will bring you closer to losing the game.</li>
<li>You have a limited number of attempts to guess the word before the hangman is complete and you lose the game.</li>
<ul>
